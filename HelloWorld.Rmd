## This is a markdown file

The text below is supplementary text provided by the R Markdown template in R Studio. As you can see, I'm a genius, why re-invent the wheel when the capability is already there, hahahaa.

I've really enjoyed the course by John Hopkins and I wish you all the best in the continuation of the course.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
